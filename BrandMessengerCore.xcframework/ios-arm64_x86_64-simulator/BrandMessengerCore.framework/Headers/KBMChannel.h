/**
 * A channel is a medium for multiple users to send and receive messages to and from each other. It facilitates a channel conversation.
 *
 * Channels are identified by their channel `key` which is auto-generated or `clientChannelKey` which is your client channel key.
 *
 * Before a user can send messages to a channel, the channel needs to be created and the user needs to either join it or be added to it. Whether a user can join a channel or not depends on the channel `type`.
 *
 *  To create a channel and add users to it, refer to `-[BrandMessengerClient createChannelWithChannelInfo:withCompletion:]`.
 *
 *  To add a user to an existing channel (it allowed), refer to `-[BrandMessengerClient addMemberToChannelWithUserId:andChannelKey:orClientChannelKey:withCompletion:]`.
 *
 * To send a message to a channel refer to `-[BrandMessengerClient sendTextMessage:withCompletion:]`.
